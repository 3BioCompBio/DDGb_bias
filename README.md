## (1) Introduction
Here are all supplementary data for DDGb bias paper [1].


## (2) Conventions and units
- All energy values are in kcal/mol and all temperature values are in K.
- By convention, destabilizing mutations have positive ΔΔGb values.
- Separator in all .csv files is ";" and missing values are marked as "XXX".


## (3) Content

### (3.1) Datasets
